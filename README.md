(Special Topics in AI)
This project aims to deepen your understanding of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by 
implementing and comparing the Vanilla GAN with one advanced GAN variant to address the 
challenge of imbalanced datasets. You will generate synthetic data for the minority class using 
both models and evaluate the impact on classification performance using standard machine 
learning metrics.
